# React Core Concepts Practice

Welcome! 👋 This project was created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of **core React practices**. The goal is to explore and experiment with the fundamental concepts that make up modern React development.

## 📚 Based On

This project is based on the course **[React – The Complete Guide (2025 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)** by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**. The course has been an incredible resource for learning both the fundamentals and advanced features of React.


## 🔍 What I'm Learning

This project focuses on the following React concepts:

- **Components** – Building and organizing reusable UI blocks
- **Component Tree** – Understanding the hierarchy and data flow
- **Props** – Passing data between components
- **Children Prop** – Composing components using nested elements
- **Event Handling** – Responding to user actions like clicks and form inputs
- **State Management** – Managing dynamic data within components
- **React Hooks** – Using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and others
- **Conditional Rendering** – Rendering elements dynamically based on logic
- **And More** – Additional best practices and React patterns as I progress

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React (with Create React App or Vite, depending on setup)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS or a component-level styling approach

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into separate folders and components to reflect different learning modules or features. Each part is designed to be easy to understand and build upon.

## 🧩 Projects Built From This Course

As part of this learning journey, I'm also building small projects that apply the concepts covered in the course. These are the projects:

- 🎮 [Tic Tac Toe in React](./03-tic-tac-toe): A simple and interactive implementation of the classic game using React components, props, and state.
- 📈 [Investment Calculator in React](./02-investment-calculator): A financial calculator that helps estimate future investment value based on user input. Built with React to practice form handling, state management, and dynamic data rendering.
- 🎨 [Styling React App](./01-styling-techniques): A reference app demonstrating various React styling techniques including vanilla CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, and dynamic styling.

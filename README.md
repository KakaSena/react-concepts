# React Core Concepts Practice

Welcome! 👋 This project was created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of **core React practices**. The goal is to explore and experiment with the fundamental concepts that make up modern React development.

## 📚 Based On

This project is based on the course **[React – The Complete Guide (2025 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)** by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**. The course has been an incredible resource for learning both the fundamentals and advanced features of React.


## 🔍 What I'm Learning

This project focuses on the following React concepts:

- **Components** – Building and organizing reusable UI blocks
- **Component Tree** – Understanding the hierarchy and data flow
- **Props** – Passing data between components
- **Children Prop** – Composing components using nested elements
- **Event Handling** – Responding to user actions like clicks and form inputs
- **State Management** – Managing dynamic data within components
- **React Hooks** – Using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and others
- **Conditional Rendering** – Rendering elements dynamically based on logic
- **Refs and Portals** – Controlling elements directly and rendering components outside the DOM hierarchy
- **And More** – Additional best practices and React patterns as I progress

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React (with Create React App or Vite, depending on setup)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS or a component-level styling approach

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into separate folders and components to reflect different learning modules or features. Each part is designed to be easy to understand and build upon.

## 🧠 Learning Materials

These resources focus on grasping the foundational principles of React through code snippets and small examples:

- 📘 [React Core Concepts](./learning-materials/01-react-core-concepts): A collection of code snippets and simple components that demonstrate the foundational principles of React, such as **components**, **props**, and **JSX**.
- 🪢 [Advanced State Management](./learning-materials/02-advanced-state-management): Learn how to avoid prop drilling by combining **Context API** with **useReducer** for centralized and predictable state logic in larger applications.

## 🧩 Projects Built From This Course

As part of this learning journey, I tackled a series of challenge projects designed to reinforce the concepts covered. Each challenge was later explained in detail in the course videos. Here are the projects:

- 🎮 [Tic Tac Toe in React](./projects/01-react-tic-tac-toe): A project built to reinforce the learning of **component composition**, **state management**, and **event handling** in React.
- 📈 [Investment Calculator in React](./projects/02-investment-calculator-react): A project built to practice **form handling**, **controlled components**, **state management**, and **rendering dynamic calculations in real time** using React.
- 🎨 [ReactArt](./projects/03-styling-react-app): A reference app demonstrating various React styling techniques including vanilla CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, and dynamic styling.
- 🌀 [The Almost Final Countdown](./projects/04-refs-and-portals): A project demonstrating how to use `ref`, `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, and `createPortal` to control components and render UI elements outside the regular DOM tree.
- 📋 [Project Manager React App](./projects/05-project-manager-react): A project demonstrating **reusable components**, data flow with **props** and **children**, user interaction with **state** and **hooks**, and advanced patterns like **conditional rendering**, **refs**, and **portals**.

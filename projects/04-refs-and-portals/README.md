# ‚è±Ô∏è The Almost Final Countdown

> Stop the timer once you estimate that time is (almost) up.

A fun and minimal countdown game built with React to practice advanced concepts like `ref`, `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, and `createPortal`.

## üß† What I Learned

This mini project helped reinforce the following concepts:

- **Refs in React** ‚Äì Accessing and controlling DOM nodes and component instances
- **`forwardRef`** ‚Äì Passing refs to child components
- **`useImperativeHandle`** ‚Äì Exposing custom methods to parent components via refs
- **`createPortal`** ‚Äì Rendering UI outside the main component tree (used for the modal)

## üïπÔ∏è How It Works

- A countdown starts automatically.
- Your goal is to **stop the timer** as close to **0.000 seconds** as possible.
- Once you stop it, a **modal appears** (via portal) showing your result.
- Try again to beat your accuracy!

# ðŸ“¦ Advanced State Management in React

This project is a **clothing store interface** where users can:

- Browse available products
- Add items to a shopping cart
- Adjust quantities of each product
- View the **total price** of all items in the cart

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How and when to use `useReducer` instead of `useState`
- How to share state across components using the **Context API**
- How to **compose reducers and contexts** for modular architecture
- How to maintain **clean and scalable state logic**
